# **Satellite images dataset**

Dataset contains images of 4239 images of water bodies and their corresponding mask image for ML model training.

[FastAI](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) is recommended for training image dataset.


The images are in binary format and hence cannot be viewed through typical image viewer.


[Matplot](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) can be used for viewing the images.
